2. Create a folder called SeleniumServer under the project

-----------------
3. Download all below nad move them to SeleniumServer folder. Make sure they are out of zip folders.
        ** Selenium Server : https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases/tag/selenium-4.17.0
        ** Chrome driver: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/
        ** Firefox driver (gecko) : https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

------------------
4. Start the grid from intelliJ terminal
    ** From the terminal, navigate to SeleniumServer folder

        *ls => list all child folders
        *cd => command is used to change directory. We need to come into the SeleniumServer folder. so use:
            cd SeleniumServer

------------------
  5. Run tests from Selenium Grid Standalone mode
    java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar standalone (from the grid docs). We need to provide the version we are using
    java -jar selenium-server-4.17.0.jar standalone

    Then we should see "Started Selenium Standalone 4.17.0" message

    To stop running the grid, use "control+C"
    To start again, use the "java -jar selenium-server-4.17.0.jar standalone" again

------------------
6. Create a feature file under grid_feature folder

@grid
Feature: grid_feature
  Scenario: TC01_chrome_test
    Given user navigates to "http://github.com" using "chrome" browser
    Then verify the title contains "GitHub"
    And close the remote driver

------------------
7.Create GridRunner class and remove Hooks from there.

Note: You can run the @grid from normal runner as well to create the step definitions

------------------
8. Create GridStepDefs class in stepdefinitions folder
